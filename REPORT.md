# UI/Theme Audit Report

## Summary of fixes
| Area | Issue | Root cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global scripts | 404 error for `js/safari-scroll-fix.js` on every page load | Template referenced a non-existent Safari helper file | Added a lightweight Safari detector (`js/safari-scroll-fix.js`) that restores expected scroll behaviour hooks without triggering a 404. |
| GSAP animations | Console warning `GSAP target .mil-progress not found` on pages without the progress bar | Progress animation ran unconditionally even when `.mil-progress` markup was absent | Guarded the animation block in `js/main.js` so it only runs when the element exists and still refreshes ScrollTrigger when absent. |
| Analytics | Cloudflare beacon request failed locally with CORS error | External analytics script enforces a strict origin list and rejects `127.0.0.1` with port | Added `js/analytics-loader.js` and replaced direct tags so analytics only load on non-local hosts, eliminating the dev-time console error while keeping production behaviour. |
| Request demo (Calendly) | Console errors about blocked Payment API when testing locally | Calendly iframe requests the Payment API which is disallowed on insecure hosts | Introduced `js/calendly-loader.js` plus a hostname-aware init that shows the styled fallback locally and loads the embed only on production. |
| Global styling | Inline padding/margin overrides and ad-hoc inline styles across HTML/JS made the theme inconsistent | Utility classes were missing for repeated spacing rules; JS fallbacks injected inline CSS | Added reusable classes in `css/style.css` (spacing, footer logo, loader/fallback panels) and updated HTML/JS to use them for consistent theming. |

## Inline-style cleanup highlights
- New utilities: `.mil-mb-0`, `.mil-mt-60`, `.mil-pt-60`, `.mil-pb-60`, `.mil-p-60-120`, `.mil-letter-wide`, `.mil-nowrap`, `.mil-footer-logo`, ratio helpers, loader/fallback, and success banner classes live in `css/style.css`.
- Hero/breadcrumb sections now rely on utilities instead of inline padding (see `ai-*.html`, `services.html`, `privacy-policy.html`, `knowledge.html`, etc.).
- Footer logos reuse `.mil-footer-logo` instead of repeated inline sizing across every page.
- `index.html` hero/media blocks and blog cards use new ratio and text-image helpersâ€”no inline `object-fit` or positioning remains.
- JS fallbacks (`js/contact-form-enhancer.js`, `js/newsletter-forms-secure.js`, Calendly fallback) now output semantic containers that inherit theme styling.

## Remaining TODOs / follow-ups
- Verify Cloudflare analytics still reports correctly once deployed (loader now skips local hosts only).
- After deployment, confirm Calendly embeds still pass Payment API checks on the production domain (logic unchanged for non-local hosts).
