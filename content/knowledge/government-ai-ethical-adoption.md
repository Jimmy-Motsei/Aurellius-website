The call comes as the country grapples with balancing technological advancement and social responsibility in the digital age. The statement highlights the need for AI implementation that prioritizes human welfare while addressing existing digital divides in South African society. This approach reflects growing global concerns about AI's impact on employment, privacy, and social equity, particularly in developing economies where technology adoption can exacerbate existing inequalities. ## Key Takeaways 1. **Ethical AI Framework**: South Africa's government is prioritizing ethical considerations in AI adoption, which will likely influence regulatory frameworks and business practices across all sectors. 2. **Inclusive Technology**: The emphasis on inclusive AI adoption suggests policies that address digital divides and ensure technology benefits all segments of South African society. 3. **Policy Direction**: Government AI policies will create both opportunities and compliance requirements for businesses operating in South Africa's digital economy. ## SA SME Relevance South African SMEs should closely monitor government AI policies as they will significantly impact business operations, compliance requirements, and market opportunities. Ethical AI guidelines may create new regulatory frameworks that SMEs must navigate, while inclusive policies could open doors for businesses serving underserved communities. The government's approach to AI adoption will also influence funding opportunities, training programs, and partnerships that could benefit local SMEs in the technology sector. --- **Source:** [Central News](https://centralnews.co.za/government-must-adopt-ai-ethically-and-inclusively-says-presidencys-digital-communications-head-athi-geleba){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} *This article provides analysis and insights based on publicly available information.
