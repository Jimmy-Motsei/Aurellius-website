- Use semantic HTML: one H1 per page; logical H2/H3 hierarchy.

- CTAs: “Begin Your Journey”, “Start Now”, “Let’s Begin”.

## Design System (lightweight)
- Palette: near-black / deep navy, off-white, subtle gold for accents.
- Type: Serif for headlines (gravitas), Sans for body (clarity).
- Layout: spacious grid, strong hierarchy, generous whitespace.
- Motion: subtle fade/slide on scroll; tasteful hover states.

## SEO / Social
- Descriptive <title> + <meta name="description"> per page.
- Open Graph tags for LinkedIn share (title, description, image).
- Alt text for images; meaningful link text.

## How to Use This (for Editors + Copilot)
1. Keep this README open while editing any page.
2. At the top of each HTML file, add the **Inline Page Prompt** (below) as an HTML comment.
3. Start editing inside the relevant `<section>`; trigger Copilot suggestions.
4. Accept/refine to keep tone, brevity, and structure.

### Inline Page Prompt (paste as HTML comment at top of each file)
